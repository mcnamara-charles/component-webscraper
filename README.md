# Computer Component Screen Scraper
Used to print a spreadsheet daily of updated prices in the form of an inventory log. Sheet is built to check prices against a base set. The base set used here configured as https://builds.cmcn.tech. Links can be added in the PRODUCT_TRACKERS file found in the trackers folder. This was built for my own use so it's configured to my needs. To configure it to your needs a moderate understanding of bs4, python 3, MIME, and more are necessary.

Because Datascraping is often met with recaptcha verification please ensure you have an instance of NordVPN on your computer as the code will interact with that. To send emails to a server please set the email info to your own.
